        <p class="hello">To someone,</p>
        <p>Who notices the mood swings of an insane girl (mood thunders what he calls),</p>
        <p>Who sit by her side whenever she gets down,</p>
        <p>Who wake up in the midnight just to see her,</p>
          <p>To make sure that she is doing good</p>
        <p> Who put his best to make her happy...
        <p>Whenever she needs his care</p>
        <p>He appears like an angel...</p>
        <p>Who sits by her side and tell the stories that she wish to hear,</p>
        <p> Who does all of those childish acts just to put a smile on her face...</p>
        
        <p>Words are not enough to explain how much he mean to her</p>
        <p>She is so obliged to have him in her life</p>
        <p>As her best friend</p>
        <p>As her boy friend</p>
        <p>As her everything</p>
